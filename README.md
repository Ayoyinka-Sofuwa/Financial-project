# SQL Queries and Predictive Analysis
In this project, the first task was to work on [SQL queries](https://github.com/Ayoyinka-Sofuwa/Financial-project/blob/main/SQL%20problem.ipynb) on a small dataset, I used [SQLite3 in python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) to execute and perform operations using pandas.

In the first data, provided, we have 15 entries for 5 unique customers with the amount they spent, and on what day it was spent.
I calculated:
* The total amount spent by all visitors.
* All users who visited in February AND spent more than 1000 naira
* The highest and lowest amount spent in each month
* The total monthly purchases.
* How much each user spends on their second purchase.
